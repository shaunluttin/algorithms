To avoid spending too much or too little time on each chapter in a text book, it can be useful, on the one hand, to timebox each chapter, and on the other, to schedule when we allow ourselves to move on to the next chapter. For instance, we might schedule to start Chapter Two on the first on January, and to restrain ourselves from starting on Chapter Two until the seventh on January. That way we can settle into the reading of Chapter One without worrying about whether we will ever get to Chapter Two or not.

So, for Terrell, 2018, this is our schedule (Chapter: Start Date) for the first read (Survey, Question, Read...) of each chapter.
