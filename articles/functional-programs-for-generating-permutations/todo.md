# Implement each Algorithm

The purpose of this ultimate goal is to become vaguely familiar with permutation algorithms and to learn F# syntax/organization.

# Refactors TODO:

* Use xs for collections and x for scalar values.
* Rename the unit tests with `functionName_whenCondition_shouldExpectation` phrasing.

# Other Goals (Maybe Someday)

* Modify the algorithms to use multiple threads. 
* Publish the repo to NuGet.
* Set up benchmarking in the unit tests.
* Name the functions according to their canonical names.
* Analyze each of the algorithms on paper to understand how they work and how we could parallelize them.
* Add comments to the libraries public API.
